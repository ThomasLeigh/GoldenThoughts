**v.0.1 - 01.02.2021 | 75 quotes.**  


## Description:
I like to collect quotes (“golden thoughts”) which I find valuable, well-worth, and therefore which can practically help me in life, remind about what’s important, etc. I care to have them present within my consciousness as often as possible, therefore I surround with them everyday - as random quotes displayed on a smartphone, within message footer, or within web-browser new tab page. *Anki* deck is a next step in this theme: **to adopt all the worthy thoughts even more effectively**.

This quote collection is completely subjective, consisting of my favorite thoughts. This is not, however, a complete set because I’ve decided to include only those quotes which are **relatively concise** (in order to still be able to memorize them  in an accessible way).

Regardless of a subjective character of this collection I hope for it to have a positive part within spreading wisdom around us :) .


## Installation
1. On Your PC download and install ([from this site][7]) the *Anki* app (*Windows*, *GNU/Linux* or *Mac*).
2. Download the newest version of the “Golden Thoughts” deck (the *Golden Thoughts.apkg* file [from this page][6])
3. Launch *Anki* and choose from the menu: *File ➜ Import...* .
4. Locate the downloaded file (*Golden Thoughts.apkg*), select it and click the “Open” button. The deck should be imported.
5. If You want, You can install *Anki* also on Your smartphone and then login and synchronize with the desktop app.


## Updates.
I think that this deck will be updated rather spontaneously :) . The newest version You’ll always find on [this *GitHub* page][6b], as well as within [*Anki* deck catalog][5].
